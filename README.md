# Phishing_Link_Verifier
The project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify URLs as either legitimate or phishing. The model will be trained and tested on a large dataset to evaluate its accuracy and performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a tool that can be used by individuals and organizations to verify the legitimacy of links before clicking on them, thereby reducing the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks.

# Model Building
The data is split into 80-20 before beginning the ML model training. This is a supervised machine learning problem, which is obvious from the dataset. The terms "classification" and "regression" refer to the two main categories of supervised machine learning issues.

The input URL for this data set is either authentic (0) or phishing (1), which presents a categorization issue. For this project's training dataset, the following supervised machine learning models (classification) are taken into consideration:

The supervised machine learning models (regression) considered to train the dataset are:

- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Clasifier
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Catboost
- Xgboost
- Multilayer Perceptrons

# Goal
The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a tool that can be used by individuals and organizations to verify the legitimacy of links before clicking on them, thereby reducing the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks.
